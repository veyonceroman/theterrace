    <p> It all began in 1977 when owner, John Koliopoulos, purchased a small piece of land in Bridgeview, IL with one thing in mind  to build a restaurant that serves quality food
        and delicious barbecue baby back ribs!  In need of a name for the restaurant, John thought hard as he stared at his new establishment situated between two apartment buildings. </p>
        <br> <p> “That’s it,” he thought – a Patio for the apartment buildings where people can enjoy great barbecue and relax!” Thus, the concept and the perfect name, “The Terrace” </p>
     <br> 
    <p> We take great pride in using only the finest quality ingredients freshly-prepared the old-fashioned way. We never cut corners! 
        Our famous Barbecue Ribs and Rotisserie Chicken Are always cooked fresh throughout the day, and our signature smoked meats – sliced Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Pulled Turkey
         – are seasoned and  slow-cooked for hours. We make our own soups from scratch daily!
        

  <center>Gratefully, John </center>
